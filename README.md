# Health Insurance Cost Prediction (Feb 2025)

This project focuses on predicting health insurance costs based on demographic data using machine learning models. The project includes hypothesis testing to identify significant factors influencing health insurance premiums.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Model Development**: Built multiple regression models to predict insurance costs based on features such as age, BMI, smoking habits, etc.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Applied statistical techniques to identify key cost-influencing factors.
- **Model Evaluation**: Used metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error) to evaluate model performance.

## Data
The dataset includes:
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index.
- **Children**: Number of children/dependents.
- **Smoking**: Whether the individual smokes (binary).
- **Region**: Region in which the individual resides.
- **Charges**: The insurance charges (target variable).
